# Matcha 🌿  
**Match energy, not just faces.**

Matcha is a modern, AI-powered dating platform designed to help people form more meaningful connections. Instead of relying only on photos and swipes, Matcha focuses on **persona-based and emotional compatibility**, and goes one step further by helping matched users plan their first date using an AI agent.

## ✨ What Makes Matcha Different

Traditional dating apps optimize for volume and attention.  
Matcha is built around **intentional matching**, emotional alignment, and reducing friction after the match.

- Persona-first onboarding instead of long questionnaires  
- Optional emotion-aware video analysis (private by design)  
- Explainable matches with clear reasoning  
- AI-powered first-date planning to turn matches into real moments

## 🚀 Features

### AI Persona Creation
Instead of filling out long forms, users create a **persona** through short guided prompts and optional video input.

- Captures intent, communication style, emotional preferences, and lifestyle signals  
- Builds a flexible, evolving representation of the user  
- Designed to feel natural, fast, and low-effort  

---

### Emotion & Sentiment Awareness (Optional)
Users can optionally submit a short video during onboarding.

- Analyzed privately for emotional expression and sentiment  
- No attractiveness scoring  
- Never publicly displayed  

This helps Matcha better understand tone, energy, and expression patterns.

### Intelligent Matching Agent
Matcha’s matching system goes beyond swipes by combining multiple compatibility signals:

- Emotional and communication traits  
- Shared interests and values  
- Intent alignment  
- Optional zodiac-based context for relationship dynamics  

Each match includes a clear explanation of *why* two users were matched.

---

### AI Date Planner Agent
Once two users match, Matcha activates a **Date Planner AI Agent** to help move the connection offline.

- Suggests first-date ideas tailored to both personas  
- Considers vibe, energy level, preferences, timing, and budget  
- Reduces decision fatigue and awkward planning  

The goal is to help users focus on the experience, not logistics.
